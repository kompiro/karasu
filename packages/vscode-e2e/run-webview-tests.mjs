/**
 * Programmatic ExTester runner for the WebView E2E suite.
 *
 * The CLI (`extest setup-and-run`) packages the extension with vsce in
 * default mode, which runs `npm list --production` against the manifest
 * to validate dependencies. That fails on this monorepo because vsce
 * does not understand pnpm `workspace:*` references.
 *
 * The extension is fully bundled by esbuild (`packages/vscode/out/extension.js`
 * pulls in `@karasu-tools/core` and `marked`), so dependency validation is
 * unnecessary at install time. We therefore drive ExTester programmatically
 * and tell vsce to skip the dependency check via the `dependencies: false`
 * option of `createVSIX`.
